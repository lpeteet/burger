Burger - Homework Week-7 Friday (Was Thursday)

# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.


### Important

Be sure to utilize the Heroku Deployment guide in the Supplement Folder.

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](burger_demo.mp4).

## Instructions

#### App Setup

1. Create a GitHub repo called `burger` and clone it to your computer.

2. Make a package.json file by running `npm init` from the command line.

3. Install the Express npm package: `npm install express --save`.

4. Create a server.js file.

5. Install the Handlebars npm package: `npm install express-handlebars --save`.

6. Install the body-parser npm package: `npm install body-parser --save`.

8. Require the following npm packages inside of the server.js file:
   * express
   * body-parser
   * express-handlebars

#### View setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `views`.

   * Create the `index.handlebars` file inside `views` directory.

   * Create the `layouts` directory inside `views` directory.

     * Create the `main.handlebars` file inside `layouts` directory.

     * Setup the `main.handlebars` file so it's able to be used by Handlebars.

     * Setup the `index.handlebars` to have the template that Handlebars can render onto.

     * Create a button in `index.handlebars` that will submit the user input into the database.

#### Directory structure

All the recommended files and directories from the steps above should look like the following structure:

```
.

├── routes
│   ├── htmlRoutes.js
│   └── apiRoutes.js
│
├── data
│   └── newBurger.js
|   |__ eatenBurger.js
